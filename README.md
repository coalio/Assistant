## What is Assistant?

Assistant is a data science library in continuous development

Assistant aspires to provide the tools required for real-world data management,
because Lua also deserves a nice data science and data analysis library.

*I'm currently the only maintainer of this project*, but I would love your contributions
and I'm currently looking for help.

So far the library it's getting at least one commit weekly, but we can make this to **two** if you contribute to build Assistant

## Currently implemented

1. Label naming, be it strings, numbers, or a combination of both
2. Column sorting by labels
3. Printing your dataframe in the form of a spreadsheet within your console
4. Smart indexing functions
5. Metamethods to make the code as simple as possible

## What Assistant should support next

1. Data analysis functions
2. Plotting and visualization
3. Memorize for higher performance
4. Importing and exporting data to different file formats
5. Integration with Torch and Torchnet for machine learning

## Contributions

I would love if you contributed to Assistant, and I wouldn't like to un-inspire you from contributing,
but to make the code easier to maintain in the long term, there's a <a href="https://github.com/coalio/Assistant/blob/master/conventions.txt">conventions.txt</a> file
  
These conventions are not very restricting, as long as it works there's no need to use a special method for it

## Usage

I provided some examples in docs/testing, I'll try to provide a full documentation for the first stable release
